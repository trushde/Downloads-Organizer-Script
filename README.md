# Downloads-Organizer-Script
Wrote a shell script using grep, awk, and sed to automatically sort files in the Downloads folder by file extension (e.g., PDF, JPG). Implemented filename cleanup, logging, and automation using macOS Automator Folder Actions, enabling the script to run automatically whenever new files are downloaded.
